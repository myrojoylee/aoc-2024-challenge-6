## Notes/What I learned

I learned how to use pseudo-elements to create this effect along with a linear-gradient in order to create the indicator.

## Credits

The CSS technique using a linear gradient with pseudo-elements was adapted from [here](https://dev.to/chokcoco/amazing-pure-css-scrolling-indicator-effect-5eja).
